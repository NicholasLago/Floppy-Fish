\section{General Information}
\subsection{Summary}
This document is intended to provide a complete encapsulation of the results of the testing that was performed during the development of and indicated in the Test Plan of the FloppyFish project.\\
\\
Specifically the document entails the details of the tests performed on specific sections of the code. The code functionality which was tested includes but is not limited to the business functions of the project, i.e. game logic and data interaction, rendering of the game objects, and support functionality.

\subsection{Environment and Pretest Background}
Floppy Fish is a project who's aim is to redevelop an open source implementation of Flappy Bird with proper documentation of project development principles. It was developed over the past few months and has completed its initial testing phase with future rounds of development and testing to come.\\
\\
The testing has been conducted by the development team (the A Team) and has been conducted on the team's local machines.\\
\\
Testing during development occurred, usually under manual structural testing in order to develop a working implementation, but no prior testing that would affect the official testing phase occurred.

\subsection{Test Objectives}
The testing phase's motivation is to uncover and confirm functional and non-functional requirements of the project.\\
\\
Specifically the testing is to ensure the validity of the implementation and its correctness (adherence to the requirements).\\
This includes:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Playable game mechanics
\item Expected rendering of game media
\item Expected game behaviour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Defect Rates}
The number of expected defects found by testing is to be or less than 10\% of the lines of project code. Those defects are expected to be the source of errors rather than an assumption of their propagation through the rest of the expected behaviour.

\subsection{References}

\subsubsection{Test Progression}
Tests will be conducted in order of function criticality. This means that testing of the core game engine will be conducted as a priority, then secondary functions such as rendering, then auxiliary functions such as audio playing. In these differing levels of criticality testing order will be done on dependencies, that is functions which call other functions will be tested after the testing of the functions called have been tested.

\subsection{Methods and Constraints}
\subsubsection{Methodology}
The method of testing for this project is to approach it from testing the core functionality is valid, then test to ensure the non-functional requirements are met to developer satisfaction (meeting of critique and feedback will influence the developers' notion of satisfaction). 

\subsubsection{Test Tools}
Specify the type of the test tools to be used.
\begin{itemize}
\item Jasmine
\item JavaScript console
\item Javascript testing framework
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extent}
The testing for this project will be near total, excluding minor syntactical code, as the project is smaller in scope and magnitude, and feasible under our circumstances.

\subsubsection{Data Recording}
An HTML page will be used to record all test results. 

\subsubsection{Constraints}
Not applicable.

\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Criteria}

Tests will be conducted using fringe cases and exceptions as tests for the limits of the functionality and will also test using a small set of "normal" cases.% In addition to fringe and normal cases, improper data types and other inputs will be tested in functions to attempt to "break" the code.

\subsubsection{Data Reduction}
In the case of unit testing, tests will be represented by boolean values to indicate their passing status. This simplifies the volume of data needed to be considered in a final abstracted view. Structural tests will also be summarized in this manner.
