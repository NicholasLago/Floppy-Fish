\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
This project is to redevelop a popular game Flappy Bird and make it compatible with computers. Once the original developer Dong Nguyen took Flappy Bird off of app stores, the countless users no longer had means to download it. This meant that people would have to find similar games to fill the void that \sout{flappy bird} \textcolor{red}{Flappy Bird} left. With this product we will bring a similar game on a platform that is located in every household. Once completed anyone with a computer will be able to play the addicting and challenging game of \sout{flappy bird} \textcolor{red}{Flappy Bird} once again! Our motivation to make this project is to bring back one of the most popular app games in the interest of entertaining millions! This is not a serious problem but does provide a significant business opportunity for our clients. Flappy Bird at its highest point was making 50 000 dollars a day. By taking this game down there is a serious gap where fans of  \sout{flappy bird} \textcolor{red}{Flappy Bird} are looking to find it elsewhere! Whether our client wishes to use this to gain profit off of people playing the game itself, or to gain extra traffic to their websites, it is an opportunity that should not be overlooked! The completed project will be a JavaScript game similar to Flappy Bird to be played on web browsers. 


\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
Our product will be an entertainment driven experience for users who are interested in games that aren\textcolor{red}{'}t too complex but still contain challenging aspects. The goals for this project are creating a JavaScript game similar to Flappy Bird, documenting all processes involved in creation and getting a website to host our game. This way the client can have a working demonstration for the product we have designed and what their patrons will see when they access the product. The advantage to making this game in JavaScript is that this will make our game very website friendly. With this we can put the game on the internet for our clients to easily relay to their customers.  These are all service goals as they allow the user to access our product easier.


\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Developers}

\section{Project Constraints}
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: The product shall operate on browsers that allow JavaScript to run (i.e. computers, tablets, phones and other devices) through a website hosting server.
\\
\\
Rationale: The client will not be using outdated technology when accessing our website for our project. The client will be preferably using an up-to-date JavaScript client. 
\\
\\
Fit criterion: Our game client will be available to clients with browsers that have JavaScript and if it doesn\textcolor{red}{'}t, will prompt the user to go to the Java website. 
\\
\\
\\
Description: The product shall be played only when connected to the internet to load the game data and upload high scores. 
\\
\\
Rationale: The client should be connected to a secure internet connection with an upload and download speed that is appropriate to play the product. 
\\
\\
Fit criterion: The product shall be approved to play for users if they have a connection with a good enough internet speed that shall be determined with market research and our game requirements.
\\
\\
\\
Description: The product shall resize to different internet browsers and the different sizes/orientation that browsers use.
\\
\\
Rationale: The client would be able to resize their browser and the product shall resize accordingly until it hits a boundary where it cannot get any smaller or bigger.
\\
\\
Fit criterion: The product shall be able to resize to browsers on all devices and sizes where the game is able to be played. The maximum and minimum sizes will be determined through the game\textcolor{red}{'}s requirements and sprite sizes.

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=6in]{ImplementationEnvironment.png} 
   \caption{Implementation Environment}
   \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
The product does not have any direct partner or collaborative applications but does rely on text and picture editors to be created. It also relies on being able to run on a browser supporting JavaScript and if put out on market, a web-hosting server with a domain name.


\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
For the product to be executed the following off-the-shelf software is required:
\begin{itemize}
\item
A web browser (usually comes with the client)
\item
JavaScript (Available from https://java.com/en/download/)
\item
A client where the web browser can run (i.e. phone, tablet, computer, etc.)
\end{itemize}

All three of the OTS software can be received for free off the Internet as it is open-source.


\subsubsection{Anticipated Workspace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for the product is anywhere. It can be played in someone\textcolor{red}{'}s house in a permanent location. It can also be played on the go, whether that be on a laptop or mobile device. As long as there an internet or mobile data connection, the product can be used. It can be inaccessible for clients where they do not have service/internet connection.


\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The schedule constraints are not applicable to our company.  The window of opportunity would have been when Flappy Bird was taken down from the mobile market as people would be given a second chance to play the game. However, a deadline has been set to the beginning of December as a chance for our team to have a goal to reach for.


\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
\sout{The amount of the budget is not applicable to us} \textcolor{red}{A budget is not applicable to this project}. We are given all the resources to re-create a project and as a result, \sout{are not funding anything} \textcolor{red}{a budget is not needed. If there are necessary products to be purchased for the development, it will an out of the pocket cost to the developers}.


\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
This game will be free to play and accessible for any user that has access to a piece of technology that can access a browser. From the browser, they can direct themselves to our project and as long as they have JavaScript, they\textcolor{red}{'}ll be able to run the project.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
Some relevant facts regarding this project are that there were 900 codes of line in the previous implementation of this game. The game has an MIT license and needs to be run through a server for other users to access the project.


\subsubsection{Business Rules}
One business rule that we\textcolor{red}{'}ve created is that everyone should have the same of amount of work and should try to take initiative at certain areas where they feel stronger.


\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Some assumptions that developers are making about the project is that all the text and photo editing software will be free and accessible for them, the web-hosting server will be free for launch and the written code will be encapsulated so that it won\textcolor{red}{'}t be taken and resold for monetary value. Since most electronic devices with Wi-Fi are able to connect to a browser, they\textcolor{red}{'}ll be able to reach a technological environment in which the product will operate.

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
\sout{N/A} \textcolor{red}{This game is intended to be used on multiple web browsers and devices which have yet to be tested at this current time. The software and hardware can be differ in the future, resulting in a possibility of unforeseen consequences. This could possibly render our game unplayable or make it interact differently with the user then intended. Additionally, the web server hosting the application could have downtime, too much server traffic or revoke its service which would result in our application being unplayable as it cannot be displayed to our end user. All members of the development team are critical to the development of this project so if any become ill and unable to work, it will cause serious delays in our timeline and maintenance of the project. }


\subsection{Off-the-shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
\begin{itemize}
\item Servers
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Modularized code components.


\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
As an open source project the original implementation can be relied upon as a prototype and source for code.


\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The new product will be one of hundreds of millions of different web addresses that host different products. It will not explode the Internet. However, if the server hosting is not able to hold all the users, then it can take down the server and other things being hosted by the server.


\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
This interface stands alone on and doesn\textcolor{red}{'}t coexist with an older system.


\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Some potential user problems as an adverse reaction from playing our project are Carpel-tunnel syndrome and eye soreness/eye strain from extended playing.


\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
The server that will host our product will not be powerful enough to hold the desired amount of users with our project growth pattern.


\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
If we one of the developers leave the team, there will be a gap in the information for how the product is implemented. There are also adverse risks if the software becomes too outdated for new upcoming browsers and technology.

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
Phase 1 Model Implementation:
This phase is important as this will be the structure and backbone of our project. This is how we will set up the game and how each module interacts with each other. This should be operational before any coding is started. The product shall be based on this model.
Phase 2 Programming Implementation:
This phase is where we actually construct the program. Here we will create the game and test it. The program shall be run on JavaScript and HTML. The program will feel as if it is a Flappy Bird inspired game.
Phase 3 Hosting and Maintenance:
This phase requires us to put the game onto a server for people to play. At this point for optimal game experience the game shall be maintained at a high standard. This shall be completed and reviewed regularly or upon notice. The program will be continually playable throughout years to come. The program will remain functional as long as the client deems fit.
